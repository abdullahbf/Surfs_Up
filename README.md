# Surfs_Up

## Purpose/Objective:

The objective was to compare the temperature statistics for June and December to determine whether an ice cream business would be sustainable throughout the year in Oahu. SQL alchemy (with SQLite) was used along with pandas to gain insights.  

Note: This readme covers SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb. 

## Results:

The following were the results obtained through the analysis:

* The mean temperatures for both months are similar (June mean temperatures about 4 degrees higher as one would expect).
* The max temperatures for both months are ideal for an ice cream business. 
* The min temperature for December is low and can be taken as a negative but the mean temperatures help allay any fears that might arise.
