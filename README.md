# Surfs_Up

## Purpose/Objective:

The objective was to compare the temperature statistics for June and December and determine whether an ice cream business would be sustainable throughout the year in Oahu. SQL alchemy (with SQLite) was used along with pandas to gain insights.  

Note: This readme covers SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb. 

## Results:

The following results were obtained through the analysis:

* The mean temperatures for both months are similar (June mean temperatures about 4 degrees higher as one would expect).
* The max temperatures for both months are ideal for an ice cream business. 
* The min temperature for December is low and can be taken as a negative but the mean temperatures help allay any fears that might arise.
 
## Summary:

The results point to the weather being desirable for an ice cream business in Oahu. Even though December seems to have more variability, the mean temperatures are high enough for the business to succeed. Some further analysis can help with the decision making process:

1) It might be helpful to obtain the results for each station on the island, especially for the month of December. This would help in finding the optimal location for the business. 
2) Data about other weather factors can be helpful too. Precipitation, wind, humidity also tend to impact people's willingness to buy ice cream.
